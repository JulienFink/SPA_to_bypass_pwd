------------------------------------
### Introduction :

The ChipWhisperer Lite makes side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks easier to perform on a target.
<br/> One part of the ChipWhisperer is a multi-purpose power analysis capture instrument whereas the other one is a target board.
<br/> Our goal is to retrieve the password of a C program running on the target using only power analysis techniques.

### Usage :

When using the `pwd_bypass.ipynb` file, make sure to run first the `Setup_Scripts` from the ChipWhisperer Lite project : `https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-jupyter`.
